            <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I started knifemaking back in 2016 in Clovis New Mexico. I got inspired by a TV show called Forged in Fire. 
                I started off using the stock removal method opposed to forging due to tool constraints. As I tooled up I started forging blades.
                I have made a variety a different types of knives but I have started to specialize in Damasacus Knives.

                    <h4>Stock Removal</h4>
                        <p>Stock Removal: Stock removal is different than forging. Whereas forging is bending the steel to your desired shape, stock removal is as it sounds,
                        removing material until you get a knife. It is much like carving a statue, you have a hunk of granite or whichever material you use, and inside that 
                        large block is your statue. <a href="https://exquisiteknives.com/stock-removal-knife-making-vs-forging/">Source</a>

                    <h4>Damascus</h4>
                        <p>Damascus, or pattern welded, steel was a term used by several Western cultures from the Medieval period onward to describe a type of steel used in 
                        swordmaking from about 300 BC to 1700 AD. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water. 
                        Such blades were reputed to be not only tough and resistant to shattering, but capable of being honed to a sharp and resilient edge. Today, the term is 
                        used to describe steel that mimics the appearance and performance of Damascus steel, usually that which is produced by either crucible forging or pattern welding.
