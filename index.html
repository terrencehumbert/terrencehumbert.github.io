      <h3>My hobbies include Hunting, Fishing, video games and knife making</h3>
        <p>I have been hunting mule deer and elk sense I was a child. It is a great hobby for exercise. It also provides meat all year for my family</p>
        <p>This is the latest knife I've made. It's Half Feather Damascus with a Ironwood Handle</p>
